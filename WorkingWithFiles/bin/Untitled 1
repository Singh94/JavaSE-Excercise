Create a class representing a person with 3 attributes Name, Occupation, Age
Create an array list and populate it with 5 of these objects (Make up the values etc.)
Create a loop to iterate through the ArrayList, writing each object to one file, recommended
IO library is BufferedWriter (Think about how you format this)
Separately, create another ArrayList and populate it with the data from the file you
just created. Recommended IO library is BufferedReader (You’re going to have to
parse it back in the format you wrote it in, use String.split())
