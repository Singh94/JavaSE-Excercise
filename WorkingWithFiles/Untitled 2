Create a loop to iterate through the ArrayList,
writing each object to one file, recommended IO 
library is BufferedWriter (Think about how you 
format this) Separately, create another 
ArrayList and populate it with the data from 
the file you just created. Recommended IO 
library is BufferedReader (You’re going to have 
to parse it back in the format you wrote it in, 
use String.split())
